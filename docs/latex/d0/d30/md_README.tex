The CHDR project aims to be the fastest and most efficient pathfinding library available.

CHDR provides a user-\/friendly API with ultra-\/low latency, minimal memory usage, and high-\/performance implementations of cutting-\/edge algorithms widely used in Robotics, Game Development, GNSS Navigation, Artificial Intelligence, and other high-\/performance applications.

Its flexible design ensures compatibility across numerous platforms, compilers, and toolchains. Offered as a lightweight, header-\/only C++17 library with a modular, standards-\/compliant architecture, CHDR compiles seamlessly under strict conditions and has passed rigorous testing with tools like Valgrind and Google\textquotesingle{}s Sanitizers.

By leveraging advanced metaprogramming techniques, CHDR strikes the perfect balance between usability and performance. It supports efficient routing in 1D, 2D, 3D, 4D, and even higher-\/dimensional spaces, making it an ideal choice for developers seeking fast and reliable pathfinding solutions.\hypertarget{md_README_usage}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Usage}{Usage}}\label{md_README_usage}
