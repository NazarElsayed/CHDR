## Background

The primary aim of the CHDR project is to develop the world's fastest and most efficient pathfinding library.

CHDR is a comprehensive pathfinding solution offering a simple API with ultra-low latency, minimal memory usage, and high throughput implementations of many state-of-the-art algorithms commonly used in Robotics, Game Development, GNSS Navigation, Artificial Intelligence, and other high-performance computing applications.

CHDR is designed for compatibility across a wide range of platforms, compilers, and toolchains. It is provided as a standalone, templated C++17 header-only library with a loosely-coupled and modular architecture that stringently adheres to standards. As a result CHDR compiles under very pedantic conditions and passes our tests with both Valgrind and Google's Sanitizers.
