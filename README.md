## Background

The CHDR project is one of the fastest and most efficient pathfinding libraries available.

CHDR provides a user-friendly API with ultra-low latency, minimal memory usage, and high-performance implementations of cutting-edge algorithms widely used in Robotics, Game Development, GNSS Navigation, AI, and other high-performance applications.

Its flexible design ensures compatibility across many platforms, compilers, and toolchains. Offered as a lightweight, header-only C++17 library with a modular, standards-compliant architecture, CHDR compiles seamlessly under strict conditions and has passed rigorous testing with tools such as Valgrind and Google's Sanitizers.

CHDR strikes the perfect balance between usability and performance. It supports efficient routing in 1D, 2D, 3D, and higher-dimensional spaces, making it an ideal choice for developers seeking fast and reliable pathfinding solutions.

### Key Features

## Usage

For guides, example implementations, and step-by-step tutorials on how to use the library, please refer to the [manual](docs/manual/getting_started.md).

**Important Notice:**

CHDR is currently in pre-release. During this time the library may undergo major changes, and you should expect a higher-than-usual occurrence of stability issues if you choose to use it at this time. Our first major release is pending, and we will publish it once we are satisfied that it meets our high standards of quality, stability, and performance.
