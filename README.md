## Background

The CHDR project is one of the fastest and most efficient pathfinding libraries available.

CHDR provides a user-friendly API with ultra-low latency, minimal memory usage, and high-performance implementations of cutting-edge algorithms widely used in Robotics, Game Development, GNSS Navigation, AI, and other high-performance applications.

Offered as a lightweight, header-only C++17 library with a modular, standards-compliant architecture, CHDR compiles seamlessly under strict conditions and has passed rigorous testing with tools such as Valgrind and Google's Sanitizers.

### Key Features
- Extremely fast searches.
- Straightforward and easy to use.
- Standalone – no external dependencies.
- Well-tested.
- Well-documented.
- Interoperable with common frameworks.
- Supports industry-standard platforms, compilers and toolchains.
- Reduced memory footprint with optimised access patterns.
- Type-agnostic.
- No RTTI.


## Usage

For guides, example implementations, and step-by-step tutorials on how to use the library, please refer to the [manual](docs/manual/getting_started.md).

**Important Notice:**

*CHDR is currently in pre-release. The library may undergo major changes, and you should expect a higher-than-usual occurrence of stability issues if you choose to use it at this time. Our first major release is pending, and we will publish it once we are satisfied that it meets our high standards of quality, stability, and performance.*
