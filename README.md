## Background

The CHDR project aims to be the fastest and most efficient pathfinding library available.

CHDR provides a user-friendly API with ultra-low latency, minimal memory usage,
and high-performance implementations of cutting-edge algorithms widely used in Robotics,
Game Development, GNSS Navigation, Artificial Intelligence, and other high-performance applications.

Its flexible design ensures compatibility across numerous platforms, compilers, and toolchains.
Offered as a lightweight, header-only C++17 library with a modular, standards-compliant architecture,
CHDR compiles seamlessly under strict conditions and has passed rigorous testing with tools like Valgrind and Google's Sanitizers.

By leveraging advanced metaprogramming techniques, CHDR strikes the perfect balance between usability and performance.
It supports efficient routing in 1D, 2D, 3D, 4D, and even higher-dimensional spaces,
making it an ideal choice for developers seeking fast and reliable pathfinding solutions.
